# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust BTW

My [Advent of Code 2023][aoc-2023] solutions in the Rust programming language BTW.

This is my first time programming in Rust so pardon me if my solutions are not written in rusitc way. The goal for me is to learn basics of Rust, it's project structure with multiple executable binaries sharing common utilities between them and attempt to write each solution in readable code, rather than in most optimal way, so eventually I can use Rust BTW in my workplace for bigger projects.

## Running solution

tldr

```bash
cargo run --bin {DAY} {ARGS}
```

Where input file is always expected at first argument, check year days solution for list of it's positional arguments (mby I should add some -h help, idk?)

All the test files and my input files are stored in `data`.
